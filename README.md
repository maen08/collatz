Other names: Hasse's problem, Syracuse problem, Kakutani problem, 3n+1 conjecture

#### Paul Erdos:
###### " Mathematics is not yet ready for such problems"

#### Aim
The aim of this project, is to find the general formula for the conjecture that gives the number of terms (Total Sequence Order - TSO) 
by applying the concepts of programming or any tech related field (AI/ML/NN).


#### Contribution
Make a PR, raise an issue or mail me direct contributing anything meaningful about the problem. 
Will be glad to hear from another side!
